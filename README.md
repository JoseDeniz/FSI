Practices of _Fundaments of Intelligent Systems_

### Tensorflow (Docker)

  * Move to `docker/` directory
  * Run `docker-compose up --build`

  And you have a Running Container with your project as a volume, so you can use your favourite IDE for Python to code.

#### Running scripts (Two options):

  1. Browser terminal:

   * Copy and paste the URL that the container shows at running. Example: `http://localhost:8888/?token=_token_`
   * In the browser, New > Terminal

  2. Container terminal

   * Run `docker exec -it my_tensorflow_container /bin/bash`
